# Project Statement: SCHOLAR-SYNC

## Problem Statement 
The current grade and enrollment management processes often lack immediate data-driven insights and a modular organization. This project addresses the need for a basic, unified system to record student scores efficiently, calculate class performance metrics, and automate grade retrieval, while demonstrating a modular code structure and the application of data analysis methods.

## Scope of the Project 
The system is a command-line interface (CLI) application with **in-memory storage**; data is not persistent across runs.
* **Included**: Role-based authentication, grade input, individual reporting, class average/std dev calculation, and set-based enrollment analysis.
* **Excluded**: Database persistence (ER Diagram is not strictly applicable), full GPA logic (uses placeholder value 3.5), and extensive unit testing.

## Target Users 
* **Teachers/Faculty**: The primary users for data input (grades) and statistical analysis (class average, standard deviation, enrollment sets).
* **Students**: Users accessing their records, scores, letter grades, and GPA summary.

## High-Level Features 
* Teacher-controlled data entry and advanced class analysis.
* Object-Oriented design using `User` and `Student` classes.
* Demonstration of set theory (`union`, `difference`) and combination generation (`itertools`).
