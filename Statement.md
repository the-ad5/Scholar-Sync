Problem Statement
The challenge addressed by SCHOLAR-SYNC is the inherent inefficiency and potential for error in the manual processes related to managing student academic data. Specifically, the system resolves the need for automated record keeping, reliable class statistical calculations, and systematic generation of project team combinations.

Scope of the Project
The SCHOLAR-SYNC project is a focused, command-line application that prioritizes the implementation of core subject concepts related to data structures and processing logic.

Inclusions:

Implementation of two distinct user roles (Teacher and Student) with specific functionalities.

Simulation of data persistence using in-memory dictionaries.

Integration of statistical functions (average, standard deviation) and combinatorial algorithms.

Exclusions:

Does not feature a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Does not utilize a formal relational database management system (RDBMS).

Excludes complex network communication or integration with external APIs.

Target Users
Teachers/Instructors: Primary users responsible for data integrity, entering and modifying student grades, and accessing class-level analytical reports.

Students: Secondary users who interact with the system to view their personal academic records and GPA summary.
